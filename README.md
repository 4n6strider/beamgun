Installing Beamgun
==

Beamgun v0.1.0 is available 
[as an MSI installer](https://s3.amazonaws.com/net.lospi.beamgun/BeamgunInstaller-0.1.0.msi) 
and as a [portable .exe](https://s3.amazonaws.com/net.lospi.beamgun/BeamgunApp-0.1.0.zip). 
We recommend you use the MSI installer so that Beamgun restarts
on reboot.

Building from source
==

Simply clone the repository:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:JLospinoso/beamgun.git
```

Open `Beamgun.sln` and build. That's it!
